## Gameplay

### Setup
- **3–8 players** (best with 4–6)
- One device per player (or shared screen)
- **3 Rounds**
- Each round has **3 questions**
- Each question there is a **new Faker**
- *The Twist*: You don't know if you're the Faker or not...

---

### Round 1: Random Topics  
> **Everyone answers about the *same category*, but the Faker gets a twist.**

- **Real Players**: Answer the **main question**  
  Example: *"Who makes the best music?"* → “Taylor Swift”
- **Faker**: Answers a **related but different** question  
  Example: *"Name a musician who has never won a Grammy."* → “Nicki Minaj”

**Faker's Goal**: Sound like you belong. Use confidence, detail, and group energy.

---

### Round 2: About Each Other  
> **Everyone picks a name of someone in the group, the Faker must blend in.**

- **Real Players**: Answer honestly about the group  
  Example: *"Who here has the most money?"* → “Sarah, she’s always buying new clothes!”
- **Faker**: Fake it convincingly  
  Example: *"Who here would need help paying rent?"* → “Probably Alex”

**Twist**: The Faker **chooses a real player’s name** and needs to convince the group that they picked that person for the actual question

---

### Round 3: Answer with a Number  
> **Everyone gives a number — but the Faker's prompt is unrelated.**

- **Real Players**: Answer truthfully  
  Example: *"How many times have you cried in the past month?"* → “3”
- **Faker**: Pick a plausible number for a **different** question  
  Example: *"How many text messages have you received today?"* → “47”

**Faker's Goal**: Try to blend in 

---

### Voting & Scoring
- After answers, **30-second discussion**.
- Everyone votes: **“Who is the Faker?”**
- Reveal:
  - **Faker caught?** → Real players get **+1 point each**
  - **Faker survives?** → Faker gets **+2 points**
- Play all 3 rounds. Highest score wins!
